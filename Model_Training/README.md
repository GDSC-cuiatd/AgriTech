### Model Training Folder

The `Model Training` folder contains subfolders and files necessary for training and using the models.

1. **Code Folder**: Contains Jupyter Notebook files for segmentation (`Segmentation.ipynb`), classification (`Classification.ipynb`), and Raspbian drone integration (`RaspbianDrone.ipynb`).

2. **Trained Model Folder**: Contains trained model files used for classification (`best_Classification_model.h5`) and segmentation (`DiseasedPlantFCN.h5`) of plant diseases. 
You can download these pre-Trained Model from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v_dAz8xNmTBGZH0w9NGfJ7mNoeH-ZHaR?usp=sharing
