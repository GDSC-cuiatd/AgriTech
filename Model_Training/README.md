## Getting Started

### Model Training Folder

The `Model Training` folder contains subfolders and files necessary for training and using the models.

1. **Code Folder**: Contains Jupyter Notebook files for segmentation (`Segmentation.ipynb`), classification (`Classification.ipynb`), and Raspbian drone integration (`RaspbianDrone.ipynb`).

2. **Trained Model Folder**: Contains trained model files used for classification (`best_Classification_model.h5`) and segmentation (`DiseasedPlantFCN.h5`) of plant diseases. 
You can download these pre-Trained Model from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v_dAz8xNmTBGZH0w9NGfJ7mNoeH-ZHaR?usp=sharing


3. **Datasets**: Dataset will only be available on Request

4. (`Plant_Disease_Classification.ipynb`) File is not fully trained which is under fine tunning and proper Training GPU Needed to train them, this is used for Defining the DIease of any effected plant.

### Usage

To use the Model Training folder:
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/GDSC-cuiatd/team_raees.git

2. Navigate to the `Model Training` folder:
cd agritech-project/Model Training

3. Use the Jupyter Notebook files in the `Code` folder for segmentation, classification, or Raspbian drone integration.

4. Utilize the trained model files in the `Trained Model` folder for classification and segmentation tasks.
